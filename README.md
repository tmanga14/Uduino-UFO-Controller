# Uduino-UFO-Controller
**This is a work in progress file, documentation will be added and extended as time goes on. Contact me if you have any questions.**

This is the code for my UFO controller that is currently under development. My main resources utilized in the development of this project are [Uduino](https://marcteyssier.com/uduino/). for interfacing with Unity from an arduino (or Elegoo board in my case) and [FastLED](http://fastled.io/) for the control of a strip of WS8112 LEDs.
